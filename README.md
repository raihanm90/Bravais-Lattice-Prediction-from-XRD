# Bravais-Lattice-Prediction-from-XRD
A project to identify Bravais crystal structures from the XRD patterns.  

Four classifier models (Naive Bayes, KNN, Random Forest Classfier and lightgbm (Gradient boost classifier)) were used to predict the lattice structure. The highest accuracy, ~60%, was obtained using the lighgbm classifier.  

The project was completed as an assignment for the [Nano281](https://github.com/materialsvirtuallab/nano281/tree/master/labs/lab3) course at UCSD. Datasets can be downloaded using Kaggle API (kaggle competitions download -c nano281fa2020).
